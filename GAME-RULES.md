# Game Rules

Triple Triad is an easy-to-play card game.

## Initial Setup

**Print out some cards.**
You likely want at least 15 cards per player.

**Print out or create a grid.**
For a two player game, a 3x3 grid is fine.
For a three or four player game,
a 4x4 grid is better.

**Print out or create some tokens.**
Coins work too. Basically, a way to mark
the card's current player.

## Getting Started

Assign each player a token color.
Deal each player an even number of cards.
Decide who goes first.

## Basic Rules

Depending on the number of players and tge grid size, the size of each player's hand varies.

- For a two player game on a 3x3 grid,
each player takes five cards from their deck.
- For a three player game on a 4x4 grid,
each player takes five cards from their deck.
- For a four player game on a 4x4 grid,
each player takes four cards from their deck.

On a player's turn,
a player places one card from their cards
in an empty cell on the grid.
The player marks that card as theirs
by placing their token color face up
on the middle of their card.

If the player's card is placed next
to another player's
previously placed card,
and the number closest to the number
on the previous card is larger,
the token on the previous card changes to
the color of the current player.

Play continues until the grid is full.
*In a three player game on a 4x4 grid,
one space will be left over in the grid.*

The player with the most cards marked
with their token in the end wins the match.
That player adds all of the cards
on the grid to their deck.

The loser picks who will play first
in the next game.

## Optional Additional Rules

### Cascade Rule

With the cascade rule,
if any card changes token color,
the cards next to the changed card are
also considered for switching token
color if the cards next to the switched
card are lesser.

### Elemental Rules

With the elemental rules,
all changes are given a one point
advantage (or disadvantage) if the
cards have competing elemental icons.

For example, if a Fire card is placed next
to a Wind card, the Fire card gets a
one point advantage in the
potential token flip. If the Fire card
is placed next to a Water card,
the Fire card gets a one point
disadvantage.

| Element | Strong Against | Weak Against |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Fire 🔥 | Wind 🌪️       | Water 💧     |
| Water 💧 | Fire 🔥       | Earth 🌍     |
| Earth 🌍 | Water 💧      | Wind 🌪️     |
| Wind 🌪️ | Earth 🌍      | Fire 🔥      |

### Win Rules

Instead of the winner getting all of the cards:

- Each player could collect all the cards
  marked with their token.
